# Motivation 
In recent years, airplane crashes seem to receive intense media attention, often framed as sensational “click-bait” headlines. This can create the impression that commercial air travel is increasingly dangerous, even though aviation is widely regarded as one of the safest modes of transportation.

Our project is motivated by two main goals:

1. Put aviation risk into context over time:

  + We want to examine how the frequency and severity of airplane crashes have changed across   decades. Are crashes actually becoming more or less common? Have fatality rates per crash changed with improvements in technology and safety regulations?
  
2. Understand patterns across aircraft, operators, and seasons:

  + We are interested in which aircraft types, operators, and seasons are associated with more frequent or more severe crashes. We also plan to explore whether climate or seasonal patterns might be related to the timing or characteristics of crashes.
  + By combining historical crash records with external data (e.g., climate data), we hope to create a clearer, data-driven picture of aviation safety trends that goes beyond anecdotal media coverage.

# Related work
Several sources inspired this project:

  + News coverage of recent crashes, which often emphasizes rare catastrophic events without context, raising questions about perceived vs actual risk.
  + Course materials on data visualization and reproducible analysis, which emphasized using public datasets to answer real-world questions with transparent code and clear graphics.
  
We are building on this existing landscape by focusing specifically on:

  + Long-term temporal trends in crash frequency,
  + Operator and aircraft-type differences.
  

# Initial questions

Core Questions

As we started the project, our main questions were:

1. Temporal trends

    * How has the number of aviation crashes changed over time (e.g., by decade or year)?
    * How has the severity of crashes (e.g., number of fatalities per crash) changed over time?
    
2. Aircraft and operators

    * Which aircraft types/models are most frequently involved in crashes?
    * Which operators/airlines experience the highest number of crashes?
    * Are some operators associated with more severe outcomes (e.g., higher fatality counts per crash)?
    
3. Seasonality and environment

    * Are crashes more common in certain seasons or months of the year?
    * Is there evidence that weather or climate conditions (from NOAA) are associated with crash frequency or severity?

As data exploration contiuued over following weeks, additional questions were developed:

  * What is the best way to present the fatalities that occured around the world? 
  * Are there notable geographic clusters of crushes? 
  * If certain aircraft or operators have very few crashes, we may shift toward grouping them            into broader categories (e.g., commercial vs military, or regional vs major carriers).
  * If to construct a linear regression model for aircraft crashes, what would it look like? 

# Data Summary 

### Data Source:
The dataset was sourced as a CSV file from Kaggle and stored in a datasets/ folder within our project directory. We read it into R using read_csv() and maintain all code in an R Project linked to a public GitHub repository for reproducibility. 

### Data: 

### Exploratory analysis
(Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.)

### Additional analysis 
(If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail)

# Discussion:
In this final stage of the project, we returned to the questions from our Motivation and Initial Questions sections to reflect on what we learned. 

The data and knowledge of the world demonstrates that as the total number of flights and passangers has increased over the decades, the aviation industry has become significantly safer due to stringent standards, advanced technology, and well-trained professionals. The absolute number of crashes has not risen in proportion to the volume of air traffic, meaning that the rate of accidents has fallen to historically low levels. 

Though the number of sudden fatalities due to aircraft crash is high and therefore is always highly covered by media outlets, commuting by air is considered one of the safest ways to commute.
