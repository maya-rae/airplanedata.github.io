# Tentative Title: "Fly High"

**Motivation**: In recent years it seems that news coverage on airplane crashes have increased, with plane crashes posing as “clickbait”. We are interested in assessing how airplane crashes have changed in severity and quantity.  

**Intended Final Products**: A website with our report, link to explainatory video, and visualization of trends, risks, and potentially explore predictors of severe or fatal crashes.


**Anticipated Data Sources**: [Aviation Crashed Flights Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandkushawaha/aviation-crashed-flights-data/data) on Kaggle.com
Potentially use NOAA weather data as well?
